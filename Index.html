  <h2>🖤 Why Monster High Is So Special</h2>
  <div class="highlight">
    Monster High wasn’t just another doll line — it was a movement that told kids
    that being different wasn’t something to hide. It was something to celebrate.
    From the very beginning, the brand centered individuality, friendship, and
    self-expression in a way that felt fresh and empowering.
